Reverse-engineer game cheats (e.g., on UnknownCheats).

Build simple anti-cheat prototypes (memory scanner, hook detector).

Contribute to open-source anti-cheat projects (like OpenAntiCheat).

Final Thoughts
Anti-cheat engineering is a niche but high-demand field. Start with the basics (C++, OS internals), then move into reverse engineering, game hacking, and finally kernel-level defenses.
